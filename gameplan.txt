SUMMARY:=================================================

Scare off predators (wolves, coyotes, etc) from harming your livestock by employing/using guardian llamas and alpacas!!! 

Many farmers use llamas and alpacas to protect their livestock because they are protective and very aware of their surroundings. If a predator approaches they make a loud call that can alert the owner. Sometimes they may chase or kick the predator as well.


GAMEPLAY:================================================
possible gameplay route. may be changed.

Begin the game with a basic llama and x amount of currency. All llamas/alpacas hae speculations- the basic one can protect up to 10 (number may change- gotta research) livestock.

Purchase livestock with currency. Livestock may include sheep, turkeys, goats, etc.

Set up your herd outside, tap "OK"!

Close the app and check back later.

Come back and check the app and see if your llama/alpaca was able to ward off any predators.
- earn currency for every predator that was warded off
- lose some livestock (or potentially your llama!) if the warding was unsuccessful.
- POSSIBLY: give llamas HP so that you can buy food/meds/etc

Use earned currency to buy more livestock and better llamas/alpacas with different specs and cute clothes. Expand your field and strengthen your fences too.


LOGISTICS:================================================
*kind of like neko atsume in the sense that you set up your place and wait/come back to see what happened.*

App data will be stored in the device with SQL.

Predator attacks and successes will be probability based.
- gotta figure out how to let that run in the background or have that be calculated while the app is opening again
